instance level is useful for building trust. However, what is also important
is understanding how the model behaves globally. Such an understanding
provides insight into both the data on which the model was trained and the
generalization power of the rules it learned. We present here an approach
that learns simple if-then rules to globally explain the behavior of black
box machine learning models that have been used to solve classification
problems. Collectively, these rules represent the pattern followed by the
model and are useful for gaining insight into its behavior. We demonstrate
the power of the approach on three publicly available data sets}, author={Puri, Nikaash}, year={2017}}

[18]. However there is no clear understanding of why they perform so well, or how they might be improved. In this paper we explore both issues. We introduce a novel visualization technique that gives insight into the function of intermediate feature layers and the operation of the classifier. Used in a diagnostic role, these visualizations allow us to find model architectures that outperform Krizhevsky et al on the ImageNet classification benchmark. We also perform an ablation study to discover the performance contribution from different model layers. We show our ImageNet model generalizes well to other datasets: when the softmax classifier is retrained, it convincingly beats the current state-of-the-art results on Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 datasets.}, booktitle={Computer Vision – ECCV 2014}, publisher={Springer International Publishing}, author={Zeiler, Matthew D. and Fergus, Rob}, editor={Fleet, David and Pajdla, Tomas and Schiele, Bernt and Tuytelaars, TinneEditors}, year={2014}, pages={818–833}}
