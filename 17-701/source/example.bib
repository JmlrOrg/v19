@article{FuhrmannAlpert2007,
abstract = {A new approach for analysis of event-related fMRI (BOLD) signals is proposed. The technique is based on measures from information theory and is used both for spatial localization of task-related activity, as well as for extracting temporal information regarding the task-dependent propagation of activation across different brain regions. This approach enables whole brain visualization of voxels (areas) most involved in coding of a specific task condition, the time at which they are most informative about the condition, as well as their average amplitude at that preferred time. The approach does not require prior assumptions about the shape of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) nor about linear relations between BOLD response and presented stimuli (or task conditions). We show that relative delays between different brain regions can also be computed without prior knowledge of the experimental design, suggesting a general method that could be applied for analysis of differential time delays that occur during natural, uncontrolled conditions. Here we analyze BOLD signals recorded during performance of a motor learning task. We show that, during motor learning, the BOLD response of unimodal motor cortical areas precedes the response in higher-order multimodal association areas, including posterior parietal cortex. Brain areas found to be associated with reduced activity during motor learning, predominantly in prefrontal brain regions, are informative about the task typically at significantly later times.},

abstract = {A major challenge for systems neuroscience is to break the neural code. Computational algorithms for encoding information into neural activity and extracting information from measured activity afford understanding of how percepts, memories, thought, and knowledge are represented in patterns of brain activity. The past decade and a half has seen significant advances in the development of methods for decoding human neural activity, such as multivariate pattern classification, representational similarity analysis, hyperalignment, and stimulus-model-based encoding and decoding. This article reviews these advances and integrates neural decoding methods into a common framework organized around the concept of high-dimensional representational spaces.},

@article{Oram1998,
abstract = {Information processing in the nervous system involves the activity of large populations of neurons. It is possible, however, to interpret the activity of relatively small numbers of cells in terms of meaningful aspects of the environment. `Bayesian inference' provides a systematic and effective method of combining information from multiple cells to accomplish this. It is not a model of a neural mechanism (neither are alternative methods, such as the population vector approach) but a tool for analysing neural signals. It does not require difficult assumptions about the nature of the dimensions underlying cell selectivity, about the distribution and tuning of cell responses or about the way in which information is transmitted and processed. It can be applied to any parameter of neural activity (for example, firing rate or temporal pattern). In this review, we demonstrate the power of Bayesian analysis using examples of visual responses of neurons in primary visual and temporal cortices. We show that interaction between correlation in mean responses to different stimuli (signal) and correlation in response variability within stimuli (noise) can lead to marked improvement of stimulus discrimination using population responses.},

abstract = {Extracting information measures from limited experimental samples, such as those normally available when using data recorded in vivo from mammalian cortical neurons, is known to be plagued by a systematic error, which tends to bias the estimate upward. We calculate here the average of the bias, under certain conditions, as an asymptotic expansion in the inverse of the size of the data sample. The result agrees with numerical simulations, and is applicable, as an additive correction term, to measurements obtained under such conditions. Moreover, we discuss the implications for measurements obtained through other usual procedures.},

@article{Zheng2016,
abstract = {Multivariate pattern analyses approaches in neuroimaging are fundamentally concerned with investigating the quantity and type of information processed by various regions of the human brain; typically, estimates of classification accuracy are used to quantify information. While a extensive and powerful library of methods can be applied to train and assess classifiers, it is not always clear how to use the resulting measures of classification performance to draw scientific conclusions: e.g. for the purpose of evaluating redundancy between brain regions. An additional confound for interpreting classification performance is the dependence of the error rate on the number and choice of distinct classes obtained for the classification task. In contrast, mutual information is a quantity defined independently of the experimental design, and has ideal properties for comparative analyses. Unfortunately, estimating the mutual information based on observations becomes statistically infeasible in high dimensions without some kind of assumption or prior. In this paper, we construct a novel classification-based estimator of mutual information based on high-dimensional asymptotics. We show that in a particular limiting regime, the mutual information is an invertible function of the expected {\$}k{\$}-class Bayes error. While the theory is based on a large-sample, high-dimensional limit, we demonstrate through simulations that our proposed estimator has superior performance to the alternatives in problems of moderate dimensionality.},
