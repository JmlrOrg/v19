    "abstract": "Robust PCA is a widely used statistical procedure to recover an underlying low-rank matrix with grossly corrupted observations. This work considers the problem of robust PCA as a nonconvex optimization problem on the manifold of low-rank matrices and proposes two algorithms based on manifold optimization. It is shown that, with a properly designed initialization, the proposed algorithms are guaranteed to converge to the underlying low-rank matrix linearly. Compared with a previous work based on the factorization of low-rank matrices  Yi et al. (2016), the proposed algorithms reduce the dependence on the condition number of the underlying low-rank matrix theoretically. Simulations and real data examples confirm the competitive performance of our method.",
