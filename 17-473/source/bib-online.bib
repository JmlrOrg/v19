  abstract = 	 {To address difficult optimization problems, convex relaxations based on semidefinite programming are now common place in many fields. Although solvable in polynomial time, large semidefinite programs tend to be computationally challenging. Over a decade ago, exploiting the fact that in many applications of interest the desired solutions are low rank, Burer and Monteiro proposed a heuristic to solve such semidefinite programs by restricting the search space to low-rank matrices. The accompanying theory does not explain the extent of the empirical success. We focus on Synchronization and Community Detection problems and provide theoretical guarantees shedding light on the remarkable efficiency of this heuristic.}

abstract="{\enspace}In this paper, we present a nonlinear programming algorithm for solving semidefinite programs (SDPs) in standard form. The algorithm's distinguishing feature is a change of variables that replaces the symmetric, positive semidefinite variable X of the SDP with a rectangular variable R according to the factorization X=RR                  T                . The rank of the factorization, i.e., the number of columns of R, is chosen minimally so as to enhance computational speed while maintaining equivalence with the SDP. Fundamental results concerning the convergence of the algorithm are derived, and encouraging computational results on some large-scale test problems are also presented.",

abstract="The low-rank semidefinite programming problem LRSDP                  r                 is a restriction of the semidefinite programming problem SDP in which a bound r is imposed on the rank of X, and it is well known that LRSDP                  r                 is equivalent to SDP if r is not too small. In this paper, we classify the local minima of LRSDP                  r                 and prove the optimal convergence of a slight variant of the successful, yet experimental, algorithm of Burer and Monteiro [5], which handles LRSDP                  r                 via the nonconvex change of variables X=RR                  T                . In addition, for particular problem classes, we describe a practical technique for obtaining lower bounds on the optimal solution value during the execution of the algorithm. Computational results are presented on a set of combinatorial optimization relaxations, including some of the largest quadratic assignment SDPs solved to date.",

  abstract = 	 {We propose a unified framework for estimating low-rank matrices through nonconvex optimization based on gradient descent algorithm. Our framework is quite general and can be applied to both noisy and noiseless observations. In the general case with noisy observations, we show that our algorithm is guaranteed to linearly converge to the unknown low-rank matrix up to a minimax optimal statistical error, provided an appropriate initial estimator. While in the generic noiseless setting, our algorithm converges to the unknown low-rank matrix at a linear rate and enables exact recovery with optimal sample complexity. In addition, we develop a new initialization algorithm to provide the desired initial estimator, which outperforms existing initialization algorithms for nonconvex low-rank matrix estimation. We illustrate the superiority of our framework through three examples: matrix regression, matrix completion, and one-bit matrix completion. We also corroborate our theory through extensive experiments on synthetic data.}

We describe a method that enables explicit detection and correction of population stratification on a genome-wide scale. Our method uses principal components analysis to explicitly model ancestry differences between cases and controls. The resulting correction is specific to a candidate marker's variation in frequency across ancestral populations, minimizing spurious associations while maximizing power to detect true associations. Our simple, efficient approach can easily be applied to disease studies with hundreds of thousands of markers.},

  abstract={This review of the development and current status of electron tomography deals mainly with the mathematical and algorithmic aspects. After a very brief description of the role of electron tomography in structural biology, we turn our attention to the derivation of the forward operator. Starting from the SchrÃ¶dinger equation, the electronâspecimen interaction is modelled as a diffraction tomography problem and the picture is completed by adding a description of the optical system of the transmission electron microscope. The first-order Born approximation enables one to explicitly express the intensity for any finite wavenumber in terms of the propagation operator acting on the specimen convolved with a point spread function, derived from the optics in the transmission electron microscope. Next, we focus on the difficulties that cause the reconstruction problem to be quite challenging. Special emphasis is put on explaining the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio in the data combined with the incomplete data problems, which lead to severe ill-posedness. The next step is to derive the standard phase contrast model used in the electron tomography community. The above-mentioned expression for the intensity generalizes the standard phase contrast model which can be obtained by replacing the propagation operator by its high-energy limit, the x-ray transform, as the wavenumber tends to infinity. The importance of more carefully including the wave nature of the electronâspecimen interaction is supported by performing an asymptotic analysis of the intensity as the wavenumber tends to infinity. Next we provide an overview of the various reconstruction methods that have been employed in electron tomography and we conclude by mentioning a number of open problems. Besides providing an introduction to electron tomography written in the 'language of inverse problems', the authors hope to raise interest among experts in integral geometry and regularization theory for the mathematical and algorithmic difficulties that are encountered in electron tomography.}

Besides conventional consistency and convergence rates of the estimates in L??([0, 1)) our results cover other metrics like Skorokhod metric on the space of cÃ dlÃ g functions and uniform metrics on C([0, 1]). We will show that these estimators are in an adaptive sense rate optimal over certain classes of "approximation spaces." Special cases are the class of functions of bounded variation (piecewise) H??lder continuous functions of order 0 < Î± â¤ 1 and the class of step functions with a finite but arbitrary number of jumps. In the latter setting, we will also deduce the rates known from change-point analysis for detecting the jumps. Finally, the issue of fully automatic selection of the smoothing parameter is addressed.},

abstract ={This paper uses probability theory to provide an approach to the Dirichlet problem for harmonic maps. The probabilistic tools used are those of manifold-valued Brownian motion and Î-martingales. Probabilistic proofs are given of uniqueness, continuous dependence on data, and existence of generalized solutions (finely harmonic maps), for target domains which have convex geometry. (This class of domain includes all regular geodesic balls.) Links are made with new results in other fields: the Î-martingale Dirichlet problem, Riemannian centres of mass (herein termed âKarcher meansâ), and the existence of certain convex functions. Future prospects include the development of the probabilistic approach in order to formulate the notion of a harmonic map defined on a fractal and to attack the corresponding Dirichlet problem.},

The detection of a specific brain pattern from the ongoing EEG activity is achieved by using the Riemannian geometry, which offers an interesting framework for EEG mental task classification, and is based on the fact that spatial covariance matrices obtained on short-time EEG segments contain all the desired information. Such a brain-switch is valuable as it is easy to set up and robust to artefacts. The performances are evaluated offline using EEG recordings collected on 6 subjects in our laboratory. The results show a good precision (Positive Predictive Value) of 92\% with a sensitivity (True Positive Rate) of 91\%.}},

     abstract = {We propose a nonparametric method for identifying parsimony and for producing a statistically efficient estimator of a large covariance matrix. We reparameterise a covariance matrix through the modified Cholesky decomposition of its inverse or the one-step-ahead predictive representation of the vector of responses and reduce the nonintuitive task of modelling covariance matrices to the familiar task of model selection and estimation for a sequence of regression models. The Cholesky factor containing these regression coefficients is likely to have many off-diagonal elements that are zero or close to zero. Penalised normal likelihoods in this situation with L1 and L2 penalities are shown to be closely related to Tibshirani's (1996) LASSO approach and to ridge regression. Adding either penalty to the likelihood helps to produce more stable estimators by introducing shrinkage to the elements in the Cholesky factor, while, because of its singularity, the L1 penalty will set some elements to zero and produce interpretable models. An algorithm is developed for computing the estimator and selecting the tuning parameter. The proposed maximum penalised likelihood estimator is illustrated using simulation and a real dataset involving estimation of a 102 Ã 102 covariance matrix.},

     abstract = {Estimation of an unstructured covariance matrix is difficult because of its positive-definiteness constraint. This obstacle is removed by regressing each variable on its predecessors, so that estimation of a covariance matrix is shown to be equivalent to that of estimating a sequence of varying-coefficient and varying-order regression models. Our framework is similar to the use of increasing-order autoregressive models in approximating the covariance matrix or the spectrum of a stationary time series. As an illustration, we adopt Fan & Zhang's (2000) two-step estimation of functional linear models and propose nonparametric estimators of covariance matrices which are guaranteed to be positive definite. For parsimony a suitable order for the sequence of (auto)regression models is found using penalised likelihood criteria like AIC and BIC. Some asymptotic results for the local polynomial estimators of components of a covariance matrix are established. Two longitudinal datasets are analysed to illustrate the methodology. A simulation study reveals the advantage of the nonparametric covariance estimator over the sample covariance matrix for large covariance matrices.},

     abstract = {Consider the problem of estimating the location vector and scatter matrix from a set of multivariate data. Two standard classes of robust estimates are M-estimates and S-estimates. The M-estimates can be tuned to give good local robustness properties, such as good efficiency and a good bound on the influence function at an underlying distribution such as the multivariate normal. However, M-estimates suffer from poor breakdown properties in high dimensions. On the other hand, S-estimates can be tuned to have good breakdown properties, but when tuned in this way, they tend to suffer from poor local robustness properties. In this paper a hybrid estimate called a constrained M-estimate is proposed which combines both good local and good global robustness properties.},

The goal of this paper is to establish the uniqueness of these functionals under broader classes of symmetric distributions. We also discuss some implications of the uniqueness of the functionals and give examples of striclty unimodal and symmetric distributions for which the MVE-functional is not uniquely defined. The uniqueness results for the S-functionals are obtained by embedding them within a more general class of functionals which we call the M-functionals with auxiliary scale. The uniqueness results of this paper are then obtained for this class of multivariate functionals. Besides the S-functionals, the class of multivariate M-functionals with auxiliary scale include the constrained M-functionals recently introduced by Kent and Tyler, as well as a new multivariate generalization of Yohai's MM-functionals.},

     abstract = {Most problems in frequentist statistics involve optimization of a function such as a likelihood or a sum of squares. EM algorithms are among the most effective algorithms for maximum likelihood estimation because they consistently drive the likelihood uphill by maximizing a simple surrogate function for the log-likelihood. Iterative optimization of a surrogate function as examplified by an EM algorithm does not necessarily require missing data. Indeed, every EM algorithm is a special case of the more general class of MM optimization algorithms, which typically exploit convexity rather than missing data in majorizing or minorizing an objective function. In our opinion, MM algorithms deserve to be part of the standard toolkit of professional statisticians. This article explains the principle behind MM algorithms, suggests some methods for constructing them, and discusses some of their attractive features. We include numerous examples throught the article to illustrate the concepts described. In addition to surveying previous work on MM algorithms, this article introduces some new material on constrained optimization and standard error estimation.},

abstract = {This work presents a fast and non-convex algorithm for robust subspace recovery. The data sets considered include inliers drawn around a low-dimensional subspace of a higher dimensional ambient space, and a possibly large portion of outliers that do not lie nearby this subspace. The proposed algorithm, which we refer to as Fast Median Subspace (FMS), is designed to robustly determine the underlying subspace of such data sets, while having lower computational complexity than existing methods. We prove convergence of the FMS iterates to a stationary point. Further, under a special model of data, FMS converges to a point which is near to the global minimum with overwhelming probability. Under this model, we show that the iteration complexity is globally bounded and locally {\$}r{\$}-linear. The latter theorem holds for any fixed fraction of outliers (less than 1) and any fixed positive distance between the limit point and the global minimum. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate its competitive speed and accuracy.},

abstract = {Natural images contain characteristic statistical
regularities that set them apart from purely random images.
Understanding what these regularities are can enable natural images to
be coded more efficiently. We describe some of the forms of structure
that are contained in natural images, and we show how these are
related to the response properties of neurons at early stages of the
visual system. Many of the important forms of structure require higher
order (i.e. more than linear, pairwise) statistics to characterize,
which makes models based on linear Hebbian learning, or principal
components analysis, inappropriate for finding efficient codes for
natural images. We suggest that a good objective for an efficient
coding of natural scenes is to maximize the sparseness of the
representation, and we show that a network that learns sparse codes of
natural scenes succeeds in developing localized, oriented, bandpass
receptive fields similar to those in the mammalian striate cortex},

@article{Sch01,
    Abstract = { This paper presents a new method for constructing models from a set of positive and negative sample images; the method requires no manual extraction of significant objects or features. Our model representation is based on two layers. The first one consists of "generic" descriptors which represent sets of similar rotational invariant feature vectors. Rotation invariance allows to group similar, but rotated patterns and makes the method robust to model deformations. The second layer is the joint probability on the frequencies of the "generic" descriptors over neighborhoods. This probability is multi-modal and is represented by a set of "spatial-frequency" clusters. It adds a statistical spatial constraint which is rotationally invariant. Our two-layer representation is novel; it allows to efficiently capture "texture-like" visual structure. The selection of distinctive structure determines characteristic model features (common to the positive and rare in the negative examples) and increases the performance of the model. Models are retrieved and localized using a probabilistic score. Experimental results for "textured" animals and faces show a very good performance for retrieval as well as localization.},

@article{decentralized,
    Abstract = { Advances in integrated technologies are making networks of many inexpensive deployable autonomous sensors a reality. Individually, each sensor may not accomplish much, but working cooperatively they have for example the potential to monitor large areas, detect the presence or absence of targets, or track moving objects. These sensors operate under constraints imposed by scarce power and other limited resources like bandwidth or computing capacity. The paper considers detection in such a distributed sensor environment. We investigate the impact on detection performance, as measured by the probability of error, of such parameters as number of sensors, number of quantization levels at each sensor, or signal to noise ratio, under a rate constraint on the common access communications channel. We optimize the local detectors when the number of sensors is large. We show that the performance loss due to quantization decays exponentially fast as the number of bits per sensor increases and that the choice between hard versus soft local detectors depends not only on the noise distribution and the quantization rate, but also on the SNR under which the sensors operate.},

     abstract = {Robust location and covariance estimators are developed via general M estimation for covariance matrix eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The solution to this GM estimation problem is obtained by transforming it into a series of robust regression problems based on a new algorithm for the singular value decomposition. It is shown here that the singular value decomposition can be represented as an iteration of two steps: a least squares regression fit of the data matrix followed by a rotation to the regression hyperplanes. An algorithm to obtain the solution to this GM estimation problem is presented, along with results of a Monte Carlo study and examples of its application. In addition, it is shown how the output of this algorithm can be used to numerically search for multivariate outliers, which is especially useful in exploratory data analysis with high-dimensional data and large sample sizes, where standard graphical techniques are difficult to implement. Because the algorithm computes robust estimates of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix, it can be used as a basis for other multivariate methods such as errors-in-variables regression, discriminant analysis, and principal components.},

  abstract = {The performance of principal component analysis (PCA) suffers badly in the presence of outliers. This paper proposes two novel approaches for robust PCA based on semidefinite programming. The first method, maximum mean absolute deviation rounding (MDR), seeks directions of large spread in the data while damping the effect of outliers. The second method produces a low-leverage decomposition (LLD) of the data that attempts to form a low-rank model for the data by separating out corrupted observations. This paper also presents efficient computational methods for solving these SDPs. Numerical experiments confirm the value of these new techniques. }

    Abstract = {Manifold learning has become a vital tool in data driven methods for interpretation of video, motion capture, and handwritten character data when they lie on a low dimensional, nonlinear manifold. This work extends manifold learning to classify and parameterize unlabeled data which lie on multiple, intersecting manifolds. This approach significantly increases the domain to which manifold learning methods can be applied, allowing parameterization of example manifolds such as figure eights and intersecting paths which are quite common in natural data sets. This approach introduces several technical contributions which may be of broader interest, including node-weighted multidimensional scaling and a fast algorithm for weighted low-rank approximation for rank-one weight matrices. We show examples for intersecting manifolds of mixed topology and dimension and demonstrations on human motion capture data.},

distribution which is spherically symmetric up to an affine
transformation. This paper deals with the robust estimation of the
location vector t and scatter matrix V by means of "M-estimators,"
defined as solutions of the system: ?i u1(di)(xi - t) = 0 and n-1?i
u2(di 2)(xi - t)(xi - t)' = V, where di 2 = (xi - t)'V-1(xi - t).
Existence and uniqueness of solutions of this system are proved under
general assumptions about the functions u1 and u2. Then the estimators
are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal. The breakdown
bound and the influence function are calculated, showing some
weaknesses of the estimates for high dimensionality. An algorithm for
the numerical calculation of the estimators is described. Finally,
numerical values of asymptotic variances, and Monte Carlo small-sample
results are exhibited.},

performances of several robust procedures for estimating a correlation
matrix and its principal components. The estimators are formed either
from separate bivariate analyses or by simultaneous manipulation of
all variables by using techniques such as multivariate trimming and
M-estimation. The M-estimators stand up exceptionally well. They and
the multivariate trimming procedure are especially effective at
estimating the principal components, including a near singularity.
However, the M-estimators can break down relatively easily when the
dimensionality is large and the outliers are asymmetric. With missing
data, the element-wise approach becomes more attractive.},

geometric construction related to "projection pursuit." They are both
affine equivariant (coordinate-free) and have high breakdown point.
The generalization of the median has a breakdown point of at least
1/(d + 1) in dimension d and the breakdown point can be as high as 1/3
under symmetry. In contrast, various estimators based on rejecting
apparent outliers and taking the mean of the remaining observations
have breakdown points not larger than 1/(d + 1) in dimension d.},

     abstract = {The existence and uniqueness of a limiting form of a Huber-type M-estimator of multivariate scatter is established under certain conditions on the observed sample. These conditions hold with probability one when sampling randomly from a continuous multivariate distribution. The existence of the estimator is proven by showing that it is the limiting point of a specific algorithm. Hence, the proof is constructive. For continuous populations, the estimator of multivariate scatter is shown to be strongly consistent and asymptotically normal. An important property of the estimator is that its asymptotic distribution is distribution-free with respect to the class of continuous elliptically distributed populations. This distribution-free property also holds for the finite sample size distribution when the location parameter is known. In addition, the estimator is the "most robust" estimator of the scatter matrix of an elliptical distribution in the sense of minimizing the maximum asymptotic variance.},

     abstract = {It has been shown by W. Gautschi that if $0 < s < 1$, then for $x \geqslant 1$ $$x^{1 - s} < \frac{\Gamma(x + 1)}{\Gamma(x + s)} < \exp[(1 - s)\psi(x + 1)].$$ The following closer bounds are proved: $$\exp[(1 - s)\psi(x + s^{1/2})] < \frac{\Gamma(x + 1)}{\Gamma(x + s)} < \exp\bigg[(1 - s)\psi\bigg(x + \frac{s + 1}{2}\bigg)\bigg]$$ and $$\bigg[x + \frac{s}{2}\bigg]^{1 - s} < \frac{\Gamma(x + 1)}{\Gamma(x + s)} < \bigg[x - \frac{1}{2} + \bigg(s + \frac{1}{4}\bigg)^{1/2}\bigg]^{1 - s}.$$ These are compared with each other and with inequalities given by T. Erber and J. D. Keè·kiè° and P. M. Vasiè°.},
